## ðŸŽ® Commands

### Menu & Saving
- `sm_savelocmenu`  
  Opens the saveloc HUD menu with options:
  - **Save** â†’ save your current position, angles, and velocity
  - **Teleport** â†’ teleport to your current saveloc
  - **Previous / Next** â†’ cycle through saved slots and teleport

### Keybind (Hold/Release)
- `+sm_teleport`  
  Teleports you to your current saveloc and **freezes** you in place until you let go of the key it is bound to.
  For example, bind mouse4 to "+sm_teleport", when you hold mouse4, it will teleport and freeze until you let go of the bind.
  
- `sm_saveloc`  
  Saves your current location into the next available slot.  
  If you already have 500 slots, the oldest one is removed.

### Teleporting
- `sm_tele <slot>`  
  Teleports you to a specific slot number (1â€“500).  
  Example: `/tele 7` â†’ teleports to slot 7.

- `sm_tele`  
  Instantly teleports you to your currently selected slot (the one you last saved or cycled to).
